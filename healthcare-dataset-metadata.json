It is designed to mimic real-world healthcare data, enabling users to practice, develop, and showcase their data manipulation and analysis skills in the context of the healthcare industry.\n\n# \u0060\u0060\u0060Inspiration:\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe inspiration behind this dataset is rooted in the need for practical and diverse healthcare data for educational and research purposes. Healthcare data is often sensitive and subject to privacy regulations, making it challenging to access for learning and experimentation. To address this gap, I have leveraged Python\u0027s Faker library to generate a dataset that mirrors the structure and attributes commonly found in healthcare records. By providing this synthetic data, I hope to foster innovation, learning, and knowledge sharing in the healthcare analytics domain.\n\n# \u0060\u0060\u0060 Dataset Information:\u0060\u0060\u0060\nEach column provides specific information about the patient, their admission, and the healthcare services provided, making this dataset suitable for various data analysis and modeling tasks in the healthcare domain. Here\u0027s a brief explanation of each column in the dataset -\n- **Name:** This column represents the name of the patient associated with the healthcare record.\n- **Age:** The age of the patient at the time of admission, expressed in years.\n- **Gender:** Indicates the gender of the patient, either \u0022Male\u0022 or \u0022Female.\u0022\n- **Blood Type:** The patient\u0027s blood type, which can be one of the common blood types (e.g., \u0022A\u002B\u0022, \u0022O-\u0022, etc.).\n- **Medical Condition:** This column specifies the primary medical condition or diagnosis associated with the patient, such as \u0022Diabetes,\u0022 \u0022Hypertension,\u0022 \u0022Asthma,\u0022 and more.\n- **Date of Admission:** The date on which the patient was admitted to the healthcare facility.\n- **Doctor:** The name of the doctor responsible for the patient\u0027s care during their admission.\n- **Hospital:** Identifies the healthcare facility or hospital where the patient was admitted.\n- **Insurance Provider:** This column indicates the patient\u0027s insurance provider, which can be one of several options, including \u0022Aetna,\u0022 \u0022Blue Cross,\u0022 \u0022Cigna,\u0022 \u0022UnitedHealthcare,\u0022 and \u0022Medicare.\u0022\n- **Billing Amount:** The amount of money billed for the patient\u0027s healthcare services during their admission. This is expressed as a floating-point number.\n- **Room Number:** The room number where the patient was accommodated during their admission.\n- **Admission Type:** Specifies the type of admission, which can be \u0022Emergency,\u0022 \u0022Elective,\u0022 or \u0022Urgent,\u0022 reflecting the circumstances of the admission.\n- **Discharge Date:** The date on which the patient was discharged from the healthcare facility, based on the admission date and a random number of days within a realistic range.\n- **Medication:** Identifies a medication prescribed or administered to the patient during their admission. Examples include \u0022Aspirin,\u0022 \u0022Ibuprofen,\u0022 \u0022Penicillin,\u0022 \u0022Paracetamol,\u0022 and \u0022Lipitor.\u0022\n- **Test Results:** Describes the results of a medical test conducted during the patient\u0027s admission. Possible values include \u0022Normal,\u0022 \u0022Abnormal,\u0022 or \u0022Inconclusive,\u0022 indicating the outcome of the test.\n\n# \u0060\u0060\u0060 Usage Scenarios:\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis dataset can be utilized for a wide range of purposes, including:\n- Developing and testing healthcare predictive models.\n- Practicing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques.\n- Creating data visualizations to gain insights into healthcare trends.\n- Learning and teaching data science and machine learning concepts in a healthcare context.\n- You can treat it as a Multi-Class Classification Problem and solve it for  **Test Results** which contains 3 categories(Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive).\n\n# \u0060\u0060\u0060 Acknowledgments:\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n- I acknowledge the importance of healthcare data privacy and security and emphasize that this dataset is entirely synthetic. It does not contain any real patient information or violate any privacy regulations.\n- I hope that this dataset contributes to the advancement of data science and healthcare analytics and inspires new ideas. Feel free to explore, analyze, and share your findings with the Kaggle community.\n\n# \u0060\u0060\u0060 Image Credit: \u0060\u0060\u0060\nImage by BC Y from Pixabay\n"}
